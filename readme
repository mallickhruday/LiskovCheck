Semi-automatic check for adherence to the Liskov Substitution Principle.

Usage example: 'liskovcheck 'c:\\path\\to\\assembly\\MyAssembly\.dll'

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Read the output and see if it makes sense:

"It looks like a Duck and behaves like an Animal."
makes it look more likely that there is strong behavioral subtyping.

"It looks like a Duck and behaves like a TransistorRadio."
makes it a lot less likely.

Definition of the Liskov Substitution Principle:



	"Liskov substitution principle (LSP) is a particular definition of a
 
	subtyping relation, called (strong) behavioral subtyping,"


		(from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle)



...also known as:



	"If it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, but needs batteries – you probably have the wrong abstraction."
